    <p>I don't want to bury the lede here: this analysis was ultimately a failure. But I did learn things! Let's walk through the stages of this analysis and see what lessons I should keep in mind for the next investigation and try out some new graphing and visualization techniques.</p>
<div class="section" id="genesis">
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>Scene: workplace cafeteria, the Monday after the first round of ncaa basketball tournament games...
&quot;I thought about buying tickets during the game but I wasn't sure we we're going to win.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I checked afterwards and prices were so much higher than earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>I'll work on my dialogue crafting skills before I try my hand as a screenwriter but above is a rough paraphrasing of how this idea came about. Two friends who had attended UVA wanted to go to the upcoming sweet sixteen game but tickets were out of their price range by the time the were ready to buy. The question for analysis: For games with undetermined participants (e.g. super bowl, March Madness, all tournament finals) how do ticket prices and available number of tickets vary throughout the time leading up to the game, particularly during the contests which determine the future participants? My hypothesis was that ticket prices would rise and availability would fall in real time as teams' fans became more sure off eventual victory.
Critique #1 (footnote, framed as a lesson &quot;write out your hypothesis&quot;): I should have written this question out in full before proceeding. Doing so would have helped me realize two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The question itself needs some refining</li>
<li>My eventual metrics were not going to fully answer this question</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The added specificity that I really needed was to clarify what was meant by &quot;ticket prices&quot;. Listed prices? On which market? Sales?</p>
<p>When I went to review my metrics for the first time, I realized I was only capturing listings (price and quantity) so I couldn't tell (1) if people were actually buying tickets or if the seller was just removing the listing or (2) what price people were actually paying (I came up with a decent proxy in the end)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-sources">
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>Once I had the question (poorly) formed, I needed to find some data. Secondary markets were going to be better suited for this analysis since I assumed they would better simulate shifting market conditions and I could scrape the data from a public website. My first choice was stubhub but I had some trouble with their api so I switched to seatgeek. I tested an r script to pull from api queries (using some regex to smooth over my awkward switch between languages) then set up a simple batch file in Windows scheduler to have it run every 5 minutes. Code included in the appendix.</p>
<p>Critique #2: invest time and effort in finding the most appropriate source of data. In addition to the errors mentioned above, seat geek sucks because it isn't stub hub, occasional data gaps</p>
<p>Show r plots
Show linked graphs (price, number, probability of winning)</p>
<p>Appendix
Code, discuss cron</p>

In the instance of 9's, people may have a natural aversion to going to the next order of magnitude and set prices for things at $0.99 or $9.99, raising the observed distribution for that digit.</td></tr>
